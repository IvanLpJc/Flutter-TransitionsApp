# Transitions App

App for showing different types of transitions between pages in a flutter application from Udemy course.

In additiono to the proper content of the section of the course, the transitions has been implemented
in a helper function with the navigation included and some customization making the code more generic 
that can be exported easily and used directly.

Also added an expandable floating action button.
